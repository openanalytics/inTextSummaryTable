Description: Creation of tables of summary statistics or counts for clinical data (for 'TLFs'). 
  These tables can be exported as in-text table (with the 'flextable' package) for a Clinical Study Report 
  (Word format) or a 'topline' presentation (PowerPoint format), 
  or as interactive table (with the 'DT' package) to an html document for clinical data review.
