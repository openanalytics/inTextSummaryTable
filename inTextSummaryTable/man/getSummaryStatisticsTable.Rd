\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.frame with dataset to consider for the summary table.}

\item{var}{Character vector with variable(s) of \code{data}, 
to compute statistics on.\cr
If NULL (by default), counts by row/column variable(s) are computed.\cr
To also return counts of the \code{rowVar} in case other \code{var}
are specified, you can include: 'all' in the \code{var}.\cr
Missing values, if present, are filtered 
(also for the report of number of subjects/records).}

\item{varFlag}{Character vector, subset of \code{var} with variable(s) 
of type 'flag' (with 'Y', 'N' or '' for empty/non specified value).
Only the counts for records flagged (with 'Y') are retained.}

\item{varLab}{Named character vector with label for each variable 
specified in \code{var}.
By default, extracted from the \code{labelVars}.
if not available, \code{var} is used.}

\item{varLabInclude}{Logical, if TRUE
the name of the summary statistic variable(s) (\code{var})
are included in the table.
This is automatically set to TRUE if more than one variable(s) 
and is specified, and FALSE if only one variable is specified.}

\item{varInclude0}{Logical, should rows with no counts 
for the count \code{var} or \code{varFlag} variable(s)
be included in the table?
Either:
\itemize{
\item{logical of length 1, if TRUE (FALSE by default) 
rows with no count are included for all \code{var}
}
\item{a character vector containing categorical \code{var} 
for which zero counts rows should be included}
}}

\item{varIgnore}{Vector with elements to ignore in the \code{var} variable(s).
The \code{data} records with such elements in \code{var} are \strong{filtered} from the data 
at the start of the workflow.}

\item{varGeneralLab}{String with general label for variable specified in \code{var}.
In case of multiple variable in \code{var}, this will be included in the table header
(see 'rowVarLab' attribute of the output).}

\item{varSubgroupLab}{String with general label for sub-group of
categorical variable(s) for count table, 'Variable group' by default.
This will be included in the final table header (see 'rowVarLab' attribute of the output).}

\item{varIncludeTotal}{This argument is deprecated, please use: 'varTotalInclude' instead.}

\item{varTotalInclude}{Should the total across all categories of \code{var} 
be included for the count table?
Only used for categorical variables (and \code{var} not 'all').
Either:
\itemize{
\item{logical of length 1, if TRUE (FALSE by default) include the total for all categorical \code{var}}
\item{a character vector containing categorical \code{var} for which the total should be included}
}}

\item{varTotalInSepRow}{Logical, should the total per variable be included in
a separated row (by default) or in the row containing the header of the variable?}

\item{rowVar}{Character vector with variable(s)
to be included in the rows.
If multiple variables are specified, the variables should 
be sorted in hierarchical order
(e.g. body system class before adverse event term)
and are nested in the table.}

\item{rowVarLab}{Named character vector with 
label for the \code{rowVar} variable(s).}

\item{rowVarDataLevels}{Data.frame with unique combinations of \code{rowVar}
to be included in columns.
Each column should correspond to \code{colVar} and as factor
if the elements should be ordered in the final table.}

\item{rowOrder}{Specify how the rows should be ordered in the final table, either a:
\itemize{
\item{String among:}{
\itemize{
\item{'auto' (by default): }{if the variable is a factor, keep its order, otherwise order alphabetically}
\item{'alphabetical': }{order alphabetically}
\item{'total': }{order rows in decreasing order of the total number of subjects
across all columns for this specific category.}
}}
\item{Function with input the summary table and output the ordered elements of the \code{rowVar}}
}
To specify different ordering methods for different \code{rowVar}, specify a list
of such elements, named with the \code{rowVar} variable.
For the table output of \code{\link{computeSummaryStatisticsTable}} (long format),
this order is also reflected in the \strong{\code{levels}} of the row factor variable.}

\item{rowOrderTotalFilterFct}{Function used to filter the data used to order the rows
based on total counts (in case \code{rowOrder} is 'total'),
To order rows based on one specific column category,
e.g. to order based on the counts in the treatment column:
function(x) subset(x, TRTP == "treatmentX")}

\item{rowOrderCatLast}{String with category to be printed in the last 
row of each \code{rowVar} (if any, set to NULL if none).}

\item{rowVarInSepCol}{Character vector with \code{rowVar}
that should be included in separated columns.
By default (NULL), all row variables are nested in the first column 
of the table.\cr
To include the groups within a \code{var} variable in a separated column, 
set: \code{rowVarInSepCol == 'variableGroup'}.}

\item{rowVarFormat}{(flextable output) Named list with special formatting for the \code{rowVar}.
Currently, only possibility is to set the variable elements in bold, with:
list(var1 = "bold").
(Use 'variable' for \code{var} or 'variableGroup' for group within categorical variables.)}

\item{rowVarTotalInclude}{Character vector with \code{rowVar}
for which the total should be reported.\cr
If the higher row variable is specified, the total across all rows
is reported. \cr
For the export, these variable(s) are formatted as factor with 
\strong{'Total' as the first level}.}

\item{rowVarTotalByVar}{Character vector with a row variable
used to categorize the row total.\cr
Note that this is only used if row total(s) is/are requested via \code{rowVarTotalInclude},
and this variable should also be included in \code{rowVar}.
This can be specified also for a specific row variable if the vector is named.\cr
For example: \code{c(ADECOD = "AESEV")} to compute total by severity 
for row adverse event term in a typical adverse event count table 
(by System Organ Class and Adverse Event Term).}

\item{rowVarTotalInSepRow}{Character vector with \code{rowVarTotalInclude}
(not in \code{rowVarInSepCol}) for which the total should be included in a separated row labelled 'Total'.
Otherwise (by default) the total is included in the header row of each category.}

\item{rowTotalLab}{(flextable output) string with label for the row with total.}

\item{rowInclude0}{Logical, if TRUE (FALSE by default),
include rows with no records, based on all combinations 
of the \code{rowVar} (assuming nested variable(s)).}

\item{rowAutoMerge}{(flextable output) Logical, if TRUE (by default) automatically merge rows,
e.g. in case there is only one sub-category (e.g. categorical variable with only one group)
or only one statistic per category.}

\item{emptyValue}{String with placeholder used to fill the table for missing values, '-' by default.
This value is typically used e.g. if not all statistics are computed for all specified
row/col/var variables.}

\item{rowVarTotalPerc}{Character vector with row variables by which the total
should be computed for the denominator for the percentage computation.
By default the total is only computed only by column (NULL by default).
If the total should be based on the total number of records per variable,
\code{rowVarTotalPerc} should be set to 'variable'.}

\item{colVar}{Character vector with variable(s) to be included in columns.
If multiple variables are specified, the variables should 
be sorted in hierarchical order,
and are included in multi-columns layout.\cr
Use: 'variable' to include the variables to summarize: \code{var}
 (if multiple) in different columns.}

\item{colVarTotal}{String with column(s) considered to compute the total by,
reported in the header of the table, by default same as \code{colVar}.
Use: 'variable' to compute total by \code{var} (if multiple).}

\item{colVarTotalPerc}{String with column(s) considered to compute the total by,
used as denominator for the percentage computation, by default same as \code{colVarTotal}.
Use: 'variable' to compute total by \code{var} (if multiple).}

\item{colInclude0}{Logical, if TRUE (FALSE by default),
include columns with no records, based on all combinations 
of the \code{columnVar} (assuming nested variable(s)).
If variable(s) are not nested, possible combinations

to be included in columns.
Each column should correspond to \code{colVar} and as factor
if the elements should be ordered in the final table.}

statistics across columns in a separated column.}
